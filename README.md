## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

## My Idea
I want to make a working clock using p5.js, my idea is a city skyline where time is visualized through its elements: 24 buildings represent hours, 60 glowing windows show minutes, and moving cars track seconds. When the alarm triggers, the buildings collapse and rebuild, symbolizing the flow of time. This design merges structure and motion, turning urban life into a dynamic clock.

## Features  
- **Hour Towers**: 24 glowing windows, to show hours.
- **Second Cruisers**: Smooth-moving cars track each passing moment. 
- **Alarm Explosion**: Buildings crumble with particle physics on alarm trigger.
- **Nocturnal Rhythm**: Moon arc syncs syncs with minutes.
- **Urban Atmosphere**: Animated debris, road traffic, and depth-lit structures.  


## Development Timeline  

****  
- Base canvas setup  
- Moon phase calculations  
- Static building layouts  

****  
- Window lighting system (hour tracking)  
- Car movement tied to seconds  
- Initial alarm trigger detection  

****  
- Building collapse physics  
- Particle debris system  
- Alarm visual effects (flashing, smoke)  

****  
- Depth layering for buildings  
- Road animation with dashed lines  
- Car design refinements  

****  
- Color palette experimentation  
- Window glow effects with millis()  
- Moon light halo layers  

****  
- Alarm rebuild sequence  
- Particle lifetime management  
- Performance optimizations  

****  
- Final lighting passes  
- Text effects with flicker  
- Code cleanup/documentation  

## Ideas I wanted to implement

- **Make Day/Night Cycle**
- **Add Digital Clock in Background**
- **Add Flickering Stars to Sky**
- **Add More lights Through out the City**
